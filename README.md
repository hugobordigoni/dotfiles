## Purpose
My environment. This is a first version. For cleaner stuffs, you can see [Holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

Mine includes settings for vim, tmux, zsh, oh-my-zsh, iterm2. It's mostly designed for python programming.

For vim, it's highly inspired by [Real Python Tutorial](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/)
